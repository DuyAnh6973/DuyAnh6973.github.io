        <h2>Book description</h2>
        <p>The Great Gatsby, Third novel by American author F. Scott Fitzgerald, published in 1925. Set in Jazz Age New York, it tells the tragic story of Jay Gatsby, a self-made millionaire, and his pursuit of Daisy Buchanan, a wealthy young woman whom
            he loved in his youth. The book is narrated by Nick Carraway, who recounts the events of the summer of 1922, after he takes a house in the fictional village of West Egg on Long Island. There he lives among the newly rich, while across the
            water, in the more refined village of East Egg, live his cousin Daisy and her brutish wealthy husband, Tom Buchanan. As the summer progresses, Nick is finally invited to attend one of the dazzling parties held by Jay Gatsby, his neighbour.
            At Gatsby’s request, Nick invites Daisy to his house, where she and Gatsby meet again and renew their relationship. Tom soon becomes aware of the affair and confronts Gatsby at the Plaza Hotel. Daisy tries to calm them down, but Gatsby insists
            that he and Daisy have always been in love and that she has never loved Tom. As the fight escalates, Tom reveals what he had learned from an investigation into Gatsby’s affairs—that he had earned his money by selling illegal alcohol. Gatsby
            tries to deny it, but Daisy has lost her resolve to leave her husband, and Gatsby’s cause seems hopeless. Gatsby and Daisy leave together in Gatsby’s car, with Daisy driving. On the road she hits and kills Myrtle Wilson, Tom’s mistress, though
            her identity is unknown to Daisy, who knew only that Tom was having an affair. Terrified, Daisy continues driving, but the car is seen by witnesses. The next afternoon George Wilson, Myrtle’s widower, arrives in East Egg, where Tom tells him
            that it was Gatsby who killed his wife. Wilson goes to Gatsby’s house, where he shoots Gatsby and then himself. Afterward the Buchanans leave Long Island, and Nick arranges Gatsby’s funeral. Fitzgerald considered The Great Gatsby to be his
            greatest achievement at the time it was published, but the book was neither a critical nor commercial success. The novel gained popularity in the 1950s, soon becoming a standard text of high-school curricula, and is now considered a masterpiece
            of American fiction. There have been several film adaptations, notably a production directed by Jack Clayton in 1974, starring Robert Redford as Gatsby, and one in 2013 directed by Baz Luhrmann, starring Leonardo DiCaprio.
