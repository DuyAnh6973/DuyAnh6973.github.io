        <h1>The Call of the Wild</h1>
        <h2>Book description</h2>
        <p>The story opens in the Santa Clara Valley in California. Buck, a large dog that is half St. Bernard and half shepherd dog, enjoys a pampered life on Judge Miller’s estate. Unbeknownst to Buck, gold has been discovered in the Arctic. There is an
            influx of men going to find fortune and an increase in the demand for sled dogs. One night, a farmhand takes Buck for a walk, then sells him to a stranger. Buck is unceremoniously thrown onto a cargo train, caged, and taken to Seattle. Buck’s
            eyes turn red with rage. Feeling a more violent version of himself awakening, he attacks anyone who comes near him. Buck is put under the care of a man in a red sweater, who uses a club to discipline him. Buck realizes that, in this new environment,
            men brandishing weapons will establish their mastery over him. Buck also befriends Curly, a kindhearted dog. Buck and Curly are sold to two Canadian men, Perrault and François, who have been sent by their government to deliver goods and look
            for gold. Perrault and François are strict but also care for Buck, and Buck accepts them as his masters. Spitz, a fierce and cruel dog, leads their sled team. Without warning, Spitz lashes out at Curly and kills her. Buck never stops hating
            Spitz after Curly’s death. Buck meets two veteran sled dogs, Dave and Sol-leks, who teach him how to be an effective sled dog. Neither dog wants to fight for leadership, and both find their purpose lies with pulling sleds. Buck becomes an
            effective member of the sled team, growing stronger and allowing a primal version of himself to awaken. One day, while the dogs chase after a rabbit, Spitz attacks Buck. The two fight to the death. Spitz overpowers Buck at first, but Buck
            prevails and kills Spitz. After his victory, Buck asserts himself as the new leader of the sled team.
